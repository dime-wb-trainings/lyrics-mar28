I go out at night
And paint the stars
I go out at night
And leave my head on the bed
I go out at night
And race my heart
I go out at night
And leave my head on the bed
Starry, starry night
This is how I wanna live
Gonna lay me down in love
I got so much more to give
Starry, starry night
This is how I wanna live
Gonna lay me down in love
I got so much more to give
